1st time answering such a question ,is this the way to answer this question?rating on 10 would be useful

5. check the color of the cup: if it's dark inside it's bad,
decorations as well (usability test)
6. volume testing: how much water can it take ?


I addition, I'd perform usability tests: When the cup is full of hot water, can it be carried by the handle without burning the hand? Can it be carried easily if there are other cups to carry?
